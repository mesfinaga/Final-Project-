Final Project Proposal

  Name: Mesfin Agachew Woldekidan 

 Format Selected: Third format (data analysis that uses wrangling and modeling)
 
Project Title: Analysing the magnitude and trend of Emergency disease using PHEM data

Project proposal workflow 

Objectives:   The goal of this project is to analyze and compare the trend and the magnitude of public health emergency cases in all regions of Ethiopia Using PHEM weekly data. Under this project, performing data wrangling (identification of problems in the data, cleaning ….) data analysis and data virtualization will be done. 

Packages: data table or dplyr, and ggplot2 will be used. 

Software use:  R software will be used for this project. 

Timeline for the project 

December 1/2023- Submit the proposal. 

December 2-4 - Understand the data issue and problems and clearly know the data before analysis 

December 4-6 - perform data wrangling (clean the data, which is renaming, relocating, selecting mutating… identifying issues, data transformation if needed, confirming the data is ready for analysis

December 7-9 – Perform data analysis (This will include, analyzing the number of cases by date and region, by country, comparing each case by region, identifying the highest and lowest burden disease, and identifying the highest and lowest prevalent regions for each disease. Compare the disease and the regions by year and month. The association between the cases and dates will be seen using a linear model.

December 10 – Data vitualization (histogram, scatter plot, boxplot). Virtualization will be done by showing the number of cases by date and region, by country, comparing each case /disease by region, identifying the highest and lowest burden disease, and identifying the highest and lowest prevalent regions for each disease. Compare the disease and the regions by year and month.

 December 11 -check the functionality, outputs, and completeness of the codes and scripts.
 
December 12 – prepare video recording.  

December 13-15 (one of the days) – Submit the final project.
